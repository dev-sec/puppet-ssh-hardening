# == Class: ssh_hardening::client
#
# The default SSH class which installs the SSH client
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*cbc_required*]
#   CBC-meachnisms are considered weaker and will not be used as ciphers by
#   default. Set this option to true if you really need CBC-based ciphers.
#
# [*weak_hmac*]
#   The HMAC-mechanisms are selected to be cryptographically strong. If you
#   require some weaker variants, set this option to true to get safe selection.
#
# [*weak_kex*]
#   The KEX-mechanisms are selected to be cryptographically strong. If you
#   require some weaker variants, set this option to true to get safe selection.
#
# [*ports*]
#   A list of ports that SSH expects to run on. Defaults to 22.
#
# [*ipv6_enabled*]
#   Set to true if you need IPv6 support in SSH.
#
# [*options*]
#   Allow override of default settings provided by the module.
