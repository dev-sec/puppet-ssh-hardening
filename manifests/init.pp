# == Class: ssh_hardening
#
# The default SSH class which installs the SSH server and client
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*cbc_required*]
#   CBC-meachnisms are considered weaker and will not be used as ciphers by
#   default. Set this option to true if you really need CBC-based ciphers.
#
# [*weak_hmac*]
#   The HMAC-mechanisms are selected to be cryptographically strong. If you
#   require some weaker variants, set this option to true to get safe selection.
#
# [*weak_kex*]
#   The KEX-mechanisms are selected to be cryptographically strong. If you
#   require some weaker variants, set this option to true to get safe selection.
#
# [*ports*]
#   A list of ports that SSH expects to run on. Defaults to 22.
#
# [*listen_to*]
#   A list of addresses which SSH listens on. Best to specify only on address of
#   one interface.
#
# [*host_key_files*]
#   A list of host key files to use.
#
# [*client_alive_interval*]
#   Interval after which the server checks if the client is alive (in seconds).
#
# [*client_alive_count*]
#   The maximum number of failed client alive checks before the client is
#   forcefully disconnected.
#
# [*allow_root_with_key*]
#   Whether to allow login of root. If true, root may log in using the key files
#   specified in authroized_keys. Otherwise any login attempts as user root
#   are forbidden.
#
# [*ipv6_enabled*]
#   Set to true if you need IPv6 support in SSH.
#
# [*allow_tcp_forwarding*]
#   Set to true to allow TCP forwarding
#
# [*allow_agent_forwarding*]
#   Set to true to allow Agent forwarding
#
# [*server_options*]
#   Allow override of default server settings provided by the module.
#
# [*client_options*]
#   Allow override of default client settings provided by the module.
